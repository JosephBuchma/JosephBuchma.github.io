This script is modified script from previous post. In addition to zsh which you
install manually it also installs
[zprezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

After installation you should manually configure gnome-terminal to use zsh
instead of bash.

### Let's .sh
You should run this script from zsh.

Shortcut: `sudo apt-get install zsh && git clone https://gist.github.com/69eb0c387d0b8c86cd3a.git /tmp/_vtzs && cd /tmp_vtzs && sudo zsh zsh_vim_tmux_setup.sh`
